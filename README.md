# Chef-Academy
Chef Academy is a VR experience which sets out to teach players usefull kitchen skills, without ever stepping in one.
naturally we are limited to what VR provides so we cant train your nose - but we can train many other usefull skills, and help train the player to prepare various different dishes from wildly diffrent styles of cooking, these will require precision and patience to master in real life, but our game will ease you into it because learning is most effective when it's fun!

this singleplayer game will be developed for the popular headset - Occulus Rift.
