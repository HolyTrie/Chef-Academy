## About the game
Chef Academy is a VR experience which sets out to teach players usefull kitchen skills, without ever stepping in one. </br>
naturally we are limited to what VR provides so we cant train your nose - but we can train many other usefull skills, and help train the player to prepare various different dishes from wildly diffrent styles of cooking, these will require precision and patience to master in real life, but our game will ease you into it because learning is most effective when it's fun!

## Formal Elements

### 1. Player
* The game is intended to handhold a single player throughout the entire cooking process of easy to complex recipes, and is intended for all ages so long as they can support the vr headset and use it effectively, and naturally will attempt to attract players with a passion for cooking or learning new things.

### 2. Goals
* The game will have several training levels which focus on specific skills - these are the starter goal for any beginner chef but can be skipped.
* Players who completed or skipped the training levels will be able to choose a recipe and cook it from start to finish, this can be repeated any number of times with 3 varying levels of difficulty, and 3-start scoring system to rate final products
* the only 'long term' goal of the game is to teach players recipes and skills, and leave them with fond memories.
* the game will explain this to the player via text, or if the player ignores that then he will learn by trial and error.

### 3. Processes
* Intro - the player will receive their acceptance letter to 'Chef Academy' which will also whimsically explain the basic rules and goals of the game and will be offered to pick a trainin level or a recipe level to procee.d
* The game loop consists of picking a recipe in the Menu to cook and a difficulty level, which will throw the player into the Kitchen, with all ingredients in their correct place (fridge, pantry, etc...), this kitchen comes fully operational with all the things required to make the recipe, and the player is expected to follow said recipe along until he prepares the final product - at which point he can either try again or submit it for review, this ends the 'level' and rates his product.
* each level will consist of recipe specific actions, all of which are basic - such as cutting, basting, poking, rolling, etc... - these are only available during the Kitchen scenario.
* all of these controls will be tied to the 'joysticks' that come with a VR headset.

### 4. Rules
* The Menu only allows to change settings for the game and picking a level/recipe to cook.
* While in the Kitchen, every tool has its own 'rule' of how it works - players learn this via trial and error or by playing the practice levels.
  for example - knives can only be used a certain way, on a cutting board, and for specific food stuffs.

### 5. Resources
* The only resources in the game are ingredients, these will be unlimited for easy levels, plentiful but limited in medium levels, and just enough to make it in hard levels.
* this really only influences the difficulty scaling, and other then challenge there is no reason to limit this resource anyway.
* note: you could think of tools as resources but maintaining those is out of scope for this game!

### 6. Conflicts
* The game will feature time sensitive trials which are only for certain recipes and may vary in difficulty, and keeping an organized kitchen will easily become a challenge for a new chef.
* there are no opponents or dilemmas for the palyer as we only want him to leanr and have fun - with obstacles being only realistic things that players will probably face in a real kitchen, and have to do more with their cooking skills then any 'unrelated' obstacle.

### 7. Boundaries
* the game will consist of a Menu and a Kitchen scenario, the Kitchen allows the player some freedom but both are closed and quite flat, as the kitchen only allows the player to move around inside it to cook recipes, players will know they cant leave it by trial and error.
* this makes it clear to the player that the kitchen is where the game is played and he only needs to figure his way around it.

### 8. Results
* every training/cooking level will feature 0-3 star results, 0 for a failed product, 1 for a successful but no so great product, 2 for a successful and really good product, and 3 is for a 'Chef' level product, these resuls are unrelated to the levels difficulty - only to the quality and precision of the entire cooking process for a specific dish (so skill based).
